# Apache Spark Machine Learning Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Apache Spark Machine Learning Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/apache-spark-machine-learning-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783551606), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Machine learning aims to extract knowledge from data, relying on fundamental concepts in computer science, statistics, probability, and optimization. Learning about algorithms enables a wide range of applications, from everyday tasks such as product recommendations and spam filtering to cutting edge applications such as self-driving cars and personalized medicine. You will gain hands-on experience of applying these principles using Apache Spark, a resilient cluster computing system well suited for large-scale machine learning tasks.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

We've provided a video for the setup required in Chapter 1 code

The code will look like the following:
```
object HelloWorld extends App {
println("Hello World!")
}
```
